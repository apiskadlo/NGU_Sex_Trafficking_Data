# (Decision: PDF references are *not* ignored by defaultâ€”remove '*.pdf' from ignore unless you want to ignore generated PDFs.)
# If you wish to ignore only auto-generated PDFs, put them in a dedicated /output folder and ignore that folder:
# output/*.pdf

# Uncomment the following line ONLY if you want to ignore ALL PDFs!
# *.pdf
